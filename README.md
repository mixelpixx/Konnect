# Konnect

**AI-assisted PCB design for KiCAD 10.** Konnect is a native KiCAD plugin — a single
Rust binary — that lets Claude and other AI assistants design schematics and PCBs
through the [Model Context Protocol](https://modelcontextprotocol.io) (MCP).

Konnect is the next-generation successor to
[KiCAD-MCP-Server](https://github.com/mixelpixx/KiCAD-MCP-Server) (Python/TypeScript),
rebuilt from scratch for production use: no runtime dependencies, no SWIG, built on
KiCAD 10's official IPC API.

## What it does

Instead of describing changes and applying them by hand, the AI works your project
directly:

- **Place and wire schematic components** — add resistors, ICs, connectors; wire them
  together by pin name
- **Lay out the PCB** — place, move, rotate, and route footprints in real time via
  KiCAD's IPC API, with full undo/redo integration
- **Run design checks** — ERC, DRC, connectivity validation, decoupling audits,
  power-rail review, BOM health checks
- **Export production files** — Gerbers, drill, BOM, pick-and-place, 3D models, PDF
- **Search JLCPCB parts** — find in-stock components in a local 2.5M-part catalog and
  suggest alternatives
- **Start from reference circuits** — USB-C, LDO, buck converter, STM32, I2C, LED
  templates with verified component values
- **Watch it happen** — a live schematic viewer auto-refreshes as the AI edits

**171 tools in 17 on-demand toolsets** (see [tool-directory.md](tool-directory.md)).
The AI loads only the toolsets it needs, keeping its context small (~2K tokens
baseline instead of ~23K). Bundled **skills and agents** teach Claude KiCAD
conventions, wiring patterns, and design-review checklists out of the box.

## How it works

| Layer | Mechanism |
|-------|-----------|
| Schematic editing | Direct `.kicad_sch` S-expression editing with atomic writes (no KiCAD required) |
| PCB editing | KiCAD 10 IPC API (NNG + protobuf) — real-time, undo-aware, requires KiCAD running |
| Exports & checks | `kicad-cli` subprocess (Gerber, PDF, ERC, DRC, …) |
| Transport | MCP JSON-RPC over stdio (default), HTTP + SSE (`transport = "http"` or `"both"`) |

## Installation

### From the KiCAD Plugin Manager (recommended)

1. Download `konnect-pcm-v<version>.zip` from [Releases](https://github.com/mixelpixx/Konnect/releases)
   (the `konnect-pcm-*` asset is the KiCAD plugin package; the other archives are
   standalone server binaries)
2. Open KiCAD 10 → **Plugin and Content Manager**
3. Click **Install from File** and select the zip
4. Restart KiCAD

Verify: open the **PCB Editor** → **Tools → External Plugins** → you should see
**Konnect**.

### Build from source

```bash
# protoc is required (protobuf code generation)
# Windows: choco install protoc / macOS: brew install protobuf / Linux: apt install protobuf-compiler
cargo build --release -p konnect
```

## Setup with Claude Desktop

After a PCM install, the server binary lives in your KiCAD documents folder:

```
C:\Users\<YOU>\Documents\KiCad\10.0\3rdparty\plugins\com_github_mixelpixx_konnect\bin\konnect.exe
```

Edit `%APPDATA%\Claude\claude_desktop_config.json`:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "konnect": {
      "command": "C:\\Users\\<YOU>\\Documents\\KiCad\\10.0\\3rdparty\\plugins\\com_github_mixelpixx_konnect\\bin\\konnect.exe"
    }
  }
}
```

Restart Claude Desktop and the Konnect tools appear. For Claude Code, drop the same
snippet into a `.mcp.json` in your project root (see [examples/](examples/)).

## Schematic viewer

A standalone viewer that auto-refreshes as the schematic file changes:

```bash
schematic-viewer.exe path\to\your\schematic.kicad_sch
```

Pan with click-drag, zoom with the wheel, `0` to fit, `R` to refresh. Also launchable
by the AI via the `open_schematic_viewer` tool.

## Requirements

- KiCAD 10 (Windows today; Linux and macOS builds are on the [roadmap](ROADMAP.md))
- `kicad-cli` (ships with KiCAD — used for exports, ERC, DRC)
- For PCB tools: KiCAD running with the target board open (IPC API)

## License: free for the little guys

Konnect is licensed under the **[GNU AGPL-3.0](LICENSE)**.

If you're a hobbyist, student, freelancer, or open-source project: **use it freely,
no strings attached.** Design boards, ship them, sell them.

If you're a business: the AGPL requires that anything you build on or around Konnect —
including software provided over a network — be open-sourced under the same license.
If that doesn't work for you, **commercial licenses are available**: see
[COMMERCIAL.md](COMMERCIAL.md).

## Relationship to KiCAD-MCP-Server

The original [Python/TypeScript project](https://github.com/mixelpixx/KiCAD-MCP-Server)
remains fully open (MIT-style) and maintained. Konnect is where new development
happens — the architecture it proved, rebuilt for production. A rough comparison:

| | KiCAD-MCP-Server | Konnect |
|---|---|---|
| Runtime | Node + Python + SWIG bindings | Single static binary |
| PCB backend | SWIG (deprecated by KiCAD) + experimental IPC | KiCAD 10 IPC API |
| Schematic backend | kicad-skip + custom loaders | Native S-expression engine |
| Tool discovery | Router meta-tools | Load/unload toolsets + observability |
| Skills / agents | — | 6 skills + 2 agents bundled |
| License | Open | AGPL-3.0 + commercial |

## Troubleshooting

**Plugin doesn't appear in KiCAD** — install via the Plugin and Content Manager (not
manual copy), then restart KiCAD.

**PCB tools return "IPC connect failed"** — open KiCAD with your board file first;
PCB tools talk to the running PCB editor.

**"kicad-cli not found"** — common install paths are auto-detected; set the path
explicitly in the plugin settings dialog or your `konnect-settings.json` if yours
is elsewhere.
